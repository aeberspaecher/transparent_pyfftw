The simple minded pyfftw wrapper
================================

Intro
-----

The `Fastet Fourier Transform in the West <http://www.fftw.org>`_ is an
incredible library. There are at least two different Python wrappers around
FFTW: `anfft <https://code.google.com/p/anfft/>`_ (which is declared dead) and
the awesome `pyfftw <http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/>`_.

anfft used to be the simplest wrapper possible. It automatically took care of
FFTW's 'wisdom' (recipes on how to compute specific transforms the fastest) and
used threads if possible. From a user's point of view, it hid all FFTW details
a simple minded user does not want to take care of. As the only downside it
didn't expose the full range of possible routines, e.g. a dedicated fft2() was
missing.

Compared to anfft, pyfftw is the more complete wrapper. These days, it even
offers `NumPy or SciPy style interfaces
<http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/pyfftw/interfaces/interfaces.html>`_ to
FFTW. However, it also exposes FFTW details such as wisdom, threads and
buffers. transparent_pyfftw is a wrapper of a wrapper that tries to hide these
details much in the spirit of anfft.

Configuring and installing
--------------------------

The only time the user needs to think about wisdom files is when preparing to
install. Configure first::

    ./waf configure --wisdom-file="/home/your_user/.pyfftw_wisdom"

The number of threads used is determined by an environment variable.
Set (using bash)

::

    export -x TFFTW_NUM_THREADS=2

to use two threads. If your FFTW does not support threads, do not set this
variable or set it to 1. If the variable is unset, a single thread is used.

Last, install with

::

    sudo ./waf install


Usage
-----

Both the NumPy and Scipy style interfaces from pyfttw are supported. Import one
of those using either of those lines::

    import transparent_pyfftw.numpy_fft as nftt
    import transparent_pyfftw.scipy_fftpack as sftt

In each case, just use this package as if you had used the NumPy FFTs or the
Scipy ones::

    nfft.fft2(your_data)

When performing new transforms, pyfftw will acquire new wisdom - to use this
wisdom in the future, call ``transparent_pyfftw.save_wisdom()``. Wisdom is
automatically loaded when the wrapper is imported.

To create a byte-aligned array, call

::

    # create an empty, byte-aligned 256 x 512 array:
    foo = transparent_pyfftw.get_empty_fftw_array([256, 512])


Optionally making your project depend on transparent_pyfftw
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you want to use transparent_pyfftw in your project without
having it as a hard dependency for users, you may use the fact that pyfftw and
thus this wrapper as well use NumPy interfaces::

    try:
        from transparent_pyfftw.numpy_fft import fft, ifft
    except ImportError:
        from numpy.fft import fft, ifft


Notes
-----

- transparent_pyfftw is pure Python and thus introduces some overhead on
  function calls. Do not use for this wrapper for very small FFTs that need to
  be fast.
- The wrapper functions are automatically created on import of one of the
  numpy_fft or scipy_fftpack modules. At that time, the keyword argument
  ``threads=x`` argument is added to pyfftw calls for pyfftw functions that
  contain certain substrings in the docstring - namely short strings indicating
  that the pyfftw function offers additional keywords compared to the Scipy or
  NumPy function. Although this approach minimises code length, it is fragile
  as it breaks as soon as pyfftw doctsrings change. You have been warned.
  The code is developed against pyfftw 0.9.2.
- The number of threads used can not be changed after transparent_pyfftw is
  imported.
